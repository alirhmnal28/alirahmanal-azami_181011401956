# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-MNIST-with-PyTorch
This repository is MLP implementation of classifier on MNIST dataset with PyTorch. In this notebook, we will train an MLP to classify images from the MNIST database hand-written digit database.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:

1. Load and visualize the data
2. Define a neural network
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!


## Getting Started

To use this repo just download the repository, open in jupyter notebook. Start creating something awesome! Good Luck!
